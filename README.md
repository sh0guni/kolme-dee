## Usage

```rust
use kolme_dee::math::vector::Vector;

// Create a new vector
let v1 = Vector::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
let v2 = Vector::new(4.0, 5.0, 6.0);

// Vector addition
let v3 = &v1 + &v2;

// Scalar multiplication
let v4 = &v1 * 2.0;

// Index access
assert_eq!(v1[0], 1.0);
assert_eq!(v1[1], 2.0);
assert_eq!(v1[2], 3.0);
```

## Operations

### Vector Operations
- Addition: `&v1 + &v2`
- Subtraction: `v1 - v2`
- Scalar multiplication: `&v1 * 2.0`
- Scalar division: `&v1 / 2.0`
- In-place multiplication: `v1 *= 2.0`
- In-place division: `v1 /= 2.0`

## Safety

- Division by zero will panic
- Index out of bounds will panic
- All operations are checked for validity
